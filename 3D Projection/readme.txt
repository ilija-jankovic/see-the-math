This C++ program displays 3D Projection in a console window. All the display
functions (such as drawing lines and filling triangles), as well as vector and matrix 
operations are coded from scratch. Libraries were only used for the very basics,
such as strings and lists, as well as the windows library to bring up the console.
The console does flicker but I made this as a proof of concept and I believe it 
achieves its intended purpose.
